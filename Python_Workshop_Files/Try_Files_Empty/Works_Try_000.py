# Python 2.7.X
# Try_000.py
# First attempt to write a script for Python

# Objective: Write a script that will calculate quadratic equation
# -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c) / 2 * a
# Inputs will be given, you will have to write the section which will do
# quadratic equation and print out the result
# Requirement 1: save result in a 'result' variable
# Requirement 2: result must be printed as floating point
# Requirement 3: Result for both -b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c) / 2 * a be
# printed

import math

a = 5.0
b = 10.0
c = 2.0
