# Lets start with arithmetic operators first...
a = 5
b = 7
result = 0

# 1. Add a and b, save the result to result variable, then print out the result.

# 2. Do rest for subtraction, multiplication, and division!

# 3. Notice a / b gives you 0. This is because both variables are integer type
# So try changing variables type into float

# Try division again

# From here, try doing modulus and exponent!
