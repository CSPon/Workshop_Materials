# Refer to Works_000.py for reference

# This exercise will help you familiarize with Python's basic keywords we are
# going to use throughout the workshop.

# To start with, print a single line which will print out "Hello World!"

# Next, declare two variables, a and b, with values 10 and 20

# Now, print values of each variables, one line per variable.
# You should get something like
# a: 10
# b: 20
