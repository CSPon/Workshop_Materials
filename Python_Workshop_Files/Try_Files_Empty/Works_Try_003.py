# Objective a: Create a for loop taking the provided list,
# and print out following output
# Output should be
# Element in [index_number] is: output

# Objective b: Create a while loop with following condition(s)
# Condition 1: While loop starts with value of 1 and
# stops when it reaches count of 100
# Condition 2: When a value is divisible by 2 AND 3, it will print
# the number and move onto next one

# Given variables should be enough to complete both objectives.
# DO NOT create your own variables
